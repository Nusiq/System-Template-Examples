# System Template Examples

This repository serves as an illustrative project showcasing the capabilities of the [System Template](https://github.com/Nusiq/regolith-filters/tree/master/system_template) Regolith filter.

## Repository Structure

The repository is designed as a valid Minecraft world, with an addition of a Regolith project located in the `regolith` directory. To test the project, simply download it into the `minecraftWorlds` directory of your Minecraft installation and generate the files by executing the Regolith project. After that, you should be able to open the world in Minecraft.

The resulting files created by Regolith will be placed in the `behavior_packs` and `resource_packs` directories within the world. For a more in-depth understanding of Regolith, refer to its [documentation](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/).

### Included VSCode Workspaces

The project includes two VSCode workspaces for your convenience:

1. **System-Template-Examples-Compiled.code-workspace:** This workspace incorporates the generated files, providing an easy way to examine them within VSCode (note that they aren't included in the respository and must be generated first).
2. **System-Template-Examples-Source.code-workspace:** This workspace includes the source files of the project, allowing convenient editing within VSCode.
